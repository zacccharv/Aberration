<h1>Description<br>--</h1>
<p>A game inspired somewhat by "Dance Dance Revolution" and other rhythm games, except you use your fingers instead of
    your feet. Made for Acerola's game jam in March 2024. The prompt was aberration, which I defined as a departure from
    what is normal. So arrows on the screen don't always match the direction they come from. Also the music is
    very glitchy, don't worry this is on purpose ðŸ˜›.

<h1>Final Notes<br>--</h1>
